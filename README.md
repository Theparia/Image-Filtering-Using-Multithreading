# Image-Filtering-Using-Multithreading
In this project, we first read the input image in `24-bit bitmap` format and store the values of three color channels of its pixels in our memory. After extracting this information, the program applies step by step the desired filters.

We implement this problem in two `parallel(muti-threaded design)` and `serial` ways.
